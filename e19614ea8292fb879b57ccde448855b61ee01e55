      "message": "We initially followed a similar approach, where the scripts were invoked directly within install_k8s.sh.\n\n### Problem\nHowever, this created an issue — since `loglibs.sh` had to be referenced using a relative path, the parent script could only be executed from within the aimlfw-dep directory, and not from any other location.\n\ni.e. we had to add the following check, which enforced that the script must be run specifically from the `aimlfw-dep` folder.\n(Refer: https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/c/aiml-fw/aimlfw-dep/+/15152/2/tools/kubernetes/install_k8s.sh#20)\n\n### Solution:\nTo remove the restriction of running the script only from the `aimlfw-dep` directory, we adopted the current approach — where the library files are first copied to a system directory, and the scripts are referenced from there instead.\n\nLet me know, if you have any comments.",
